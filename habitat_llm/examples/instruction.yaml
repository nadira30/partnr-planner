  - Overview:
    You are controlling Agent_0 and Agent_1 in a house. The goal is to collaboratively complete a task that involves moving, picking, and placing objects. Each agent can take **one action at a time**. Your objective is to assign optimal actions to both agents simultaneously, ensuring they **do not interfere** with each other and maximize task efficiency.

  - Instructions:
    1. Consider the current task, object locations, and each agent's state.
    2. Assign exactly **one action per agent**.
    3. Avoid assigning tasks to an agent that the other agent is already performing.
    4. Actions include: `Explore[room_name]`, `Rearrange[object, on, receptacle, next_to, object_ref]`, `Pick[object]`, `Place[object, receptacle]`, `Wait[]`.
    5. If an agent has no immediate action, assign `Wait[]`.

  - Example:
    Task: Put the plant saucer and toy airplane on the bedroom table. Put the phone stand and kettle on the kitchen counter.

    House description:
    bedroom_0: table_0, bed_0, chair_0
    kitchen_0: counter_0, fridge_0, cabinet_0
    living_room_0: couch_0, table_1, chair_1

    Objects found in the house so far:
    plant_saucer_0: living_room_0
    toy_airplane_0: bedroom_0
    phone_stand_0: living_room_0
    kettle_0: kitchen_0

    Task progress:
    Agent 0 is walking in the bedroom.
    Agent 1 is waiting in the kitchen.

    Your agent's observations of the last executed action (if available):

    Thought: Agent 0 can move the toy_airplane_0 to the bedroom table, while Agent 1 can pick up the kettle_0 and move it to the kitchen counter. Both agents can act simultaneously without interfering.

    Agent_0_Action: Rearrange[toy_airplane_0, on, table_0, None, None]
    Agent_1_Action: Rearrange[kettle_0, on, counter_0, None, None]
    Assigned!
